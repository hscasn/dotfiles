# Files that start with dots and that are mine

- Files in ./home should be dotfiles or directories
  - Files/directories in the top level of this directory
    will receive a "." in front of their names, this
    means that dot files such as .bashrc and directories
    such as .config should NOT have a dot in their names.
    This only applies to files and directories in the top
    level.
  - Files in ./home will be moved to ~/
- Files in ./fonts should be fonts, and will be moved
  to /usr/share/fonts
- The "bundle" directory in .vim and .vimpkg should
  stay the same if you install more packages
